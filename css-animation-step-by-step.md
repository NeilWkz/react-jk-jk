## Setup your style space

Add a `_variable.scss` Declare your constants, in SCSS, we need to start with our device widths.
Add a container class to wrap your app, setup a basic layout. Add some fonts to your `index.html` and setup some `font-family` rules. We don't want to style it too much just enough so we can stand to look at it during development
